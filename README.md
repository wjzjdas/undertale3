Undertale 3 is a thrilling, 2D RPG-style adventure where the player, represented by a red heart, faces off against the formidable boss, Brother Ma. To emerge victorious, you’ll dodge a relentless onslaught of bullets, traps, and unique attacks inside a three-by-three grid arena. Each second is crucial, as Brother Ma’s health bar gradually depletes over time—yet to win, you’ll need to survive the countdown before losing all three of your lifes.
